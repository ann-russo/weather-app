# Description
This is a weather website made during a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/">Node.js Udemy course</a>.

It uses APIs from mapbox.com and weatherstack.com to convert the location entered by the user to latitude and longitude, and then use it to retrieve the current weather data.

The website was deployed to Heroku and can be accessed at: https://urusova-weather-app.herokuapp.com/
